# Re-admission

**Problem Statement**

Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission of diabetic patients based on their medical history, diagnosis data, medication, demographics, and treatment data. The goal is to provide healthcare providers with a tool to identify patients at high risk of readmission, enabling targeted interventions to reduce readmission rates and improve pa6ent outcomes.

prediction?select=diabetic_data.csv 

**Strategy**

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

2. Key Variables

• Target Variable: Readmission status

• Features: admission_type_id, discharge_disposition_id, time_in_hospital, medical_specialty,   num_procedures, num_medications, number_inpatient, number_outpatient, number_emergency, diag_1, number_diagnoses, change

3. Feature Selection and Engineering
   Based on p-values, pair-plots, Accuracy, precision

4. Model Training and Evaluation
   Trained the model using machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
   Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall.

5. Deployment
   Developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

**Next Steps**

1)Modify User interface
2)Feature selection
3)Improve Accuracy
